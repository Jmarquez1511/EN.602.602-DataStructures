The program was developed using Pycharm 2021.3.1 on Python 3.10.

The program can be run as a module with real inputs from the command line. I personally ran the program succesfully in Windows Powershell.

In order to run the program the following command can be used:
python -m SourceCode <some_input_file><some_output_file>

An example using the required test input file along with an output file called 'RequiredOutput.txt' would be:
python -m SourceCode Input/RequiredInput.txt Output/RequiredOutput.txt

The resulting output file will be stored as specified and there will also be a printout in powershell.
