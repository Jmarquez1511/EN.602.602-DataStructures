# EN.602.602-DataStructures
Work produced for Johns Hopkins University Data Structures class (EN.602.602). I have only uploaded the individual programming labs. Under each programming Lab you will find the code, analysis, and output produced. Below a brief description of each assignment.

## Lab 1 - Use of Stacks
In this assignment you will a use a stack to convert prefix expressions directly to postfix expressions. You may not use recursion as we will use recursion to revisit this problem in Lab 2.
Write a program that accepts a prefix expression containing single letter operands and the operators +, -, *, /, and $ (representing exponentiation). Output the corresponding postfix epression.

## Lab 2 - Use of Recurssion
In this assignment you will use recursion to convert prefix expressions directly to postfix expressions. You may not use a stack as you did in Lab 1.
Write a program that accepts a prefix expression containing single letter operands and the operators +, -, *, /, and $ (representing exponentiation). Output the corresponding postfix epression.

## Lab 3 - Huffman Coding
Using a provided frequency table, build a Huffman Encoding Tree.  Resolve ties by giving single letter groups precedence (put to the left) over multiple letter groups, then alphabetically.  Do not worry about punctuation or capitalization.

## Lab 4 - Comparing variations of Quick Sort and Merge Sort
This lab assignment requires you to compare the performance of two distinct sorting algorithms to obtain some appreciation for the parameters to be considered in selecting an appropriate sort.  Write a Quicksort and a Natural Merge Sort. They should both be recursive or both be iterative, so that the overhead of recursion will not be a factor in your comparisons.
