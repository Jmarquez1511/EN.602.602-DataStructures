The program was developed using Pycharm 2021.3.1 on Python 3.10.

The program can be run as a module with real inputs from the command line. I personally ran the program succesfully in Windows Powershell.

The file is designed to run without any input. That is, it generates the files, reads them back, sorts them, and generates the output files.

In order to execute from command, please do:

python -m SourceCode
